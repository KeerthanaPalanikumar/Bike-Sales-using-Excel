# Bike Sales Project
## Overview:
This project involves analyzing bike sales data to extract meaningful insights. The project includes data cleaning, the creation of pivot tables, a sales dashboard, and data filtering using slicing techniques.

## Project Structure:
- **Data Cleaning:** Initial step to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Pivot Tables:** Used to summarize and analyze the cleaned data.
- **Sales Dashboard:** An interactive dashboard to visualize key sales metrics.
- **Data Slicing:** Applied to filter the data for more detailed analysis.

## Steps:
## 1. Data Cleaning
**Objective:** Remove inconsistencies and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Actions:
- Removed duplicate entries.
- Handled missing values.
- Corrected data types (e.g., dates, numerical values).
- Standardized categorical values.

## 2. Pivot Tables
**Objective:** Summarize and analyze the cleaned data.
Actions:
- Created pivot tables to summarize sales by various dimensions such as date, product category, region, etc.
- Calculated key metrics such as total sales, average sales per unit, and sales trends over time.

## 3. Sales Dashboard
**Objective:** Visualize key sales metrics in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
Actions:
- Created charts and graphs to visualize sales performance.
- Included key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, top-selling products, and sales by region.
- Used slicers to allow users to filter the data by different dimensions such as date range, product category, and region.

## 4. Data Slicing
**Objective:** Enable detailed analysis through filtering.
Actions:
- Implemented slicers and filters to allow users to view specific subsets of the data.
- Enabled detailed analysis by allowing users to drill down into specific aspects of the data.

## How to Use
- **Open the Excel File:** Start by opening the Bike_Sales_Analysis.xlsx file.
- **Explore the Pivot Tables:** Navigate to the Pivot Tables sheet to see summarized data.
- **Interact with the Dashboard:** Use the slicers on the Sales Dashboard sheet to filter data and view different visualizations.
- **Analyze Specific Data:** Use data slicing features to filter the dataset based on specific criteria such as time period, product category, or region.
